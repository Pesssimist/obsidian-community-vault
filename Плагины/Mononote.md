# Mononote

<https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-mononote>

This plugin ensures each note occupies only one tabÂ **per window pane**. If a note is already open, its existing tab will be focussed instead of opening the same file in the current tab. Works for opening notes via links, menus, hotkeys.
