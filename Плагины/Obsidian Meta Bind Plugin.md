# Obsidian Meta Bind Plugin

<https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin>

A plugin for Obsidian to make your notes interactive with inline input fields, metadata displays (view fields), and buttons.

Meta Bind allows you to create input and view fields inside your notes. Those input and view fields can then be bound to frontmatter properties, which keeps them in sync with those frontmatter properties. This allows you to edit and view your frontmatter properties inside your notes.
